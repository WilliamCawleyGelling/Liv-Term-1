       <h2> About Me  </h2>
       <p> I have strong interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate complex technical concepts making them appropriate for varied audiences. I am self-motivated and drawn to challenging projects which facilitate my passion for problem solving, using my proven leadership abilities and interpersonal skills.  </p> 
       <p> My mathematics degree required a solution-oriented approach to problem solving and data analysis. For example, I conducted numerical analysis using Java and used dynamical systems to create mathematical models (e.g. modelling viruses). To facilitate my research, I taught myself Maple skills, Latex and sophisticated Excel. </p> 
       <p> Currently I am compleating my MSc in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. This will be expanding my Skills to inlcude HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL as well as further devolpe those I already have. </p>
